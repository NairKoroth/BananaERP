# BananaERP
Start of something legendary.

ERPs and administrative software were among the earliest software systems developed by engineers. Yet, despite decades of evolution, this space remains one of the least innovative and most resistant to meaningful transformation.

In the AI era, the opportunity—and necessity—to completely reimagine ERP from the ground up has never been clearer. Banana ERP is our first step toward fundamentally reinventing this category.

# Why Banana?
**The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, including the complete works of William Shakespeare.**

Prediction: With the current pace of innovation in AI, a monkey will write a Shakespeare-level book within the next 10 years, yet there will still be organizations running on antique ERP software.
